FAQ
-----------
Q: I don't like feature X, can you remove it? \
A: The ingame menu has a list of all patches. You can click them and restart the game to effectively get rid of any feature. This might cause issues with the save, if you already picked feats which are generated by said patch. In case the menu is not up to date, you can also read the patch names from the log and add them manually in the settings.json file. You can disable a whole category with the asterisk symbol like so "General.*".

Q: Can you make feature X? \
A: At the moment I have enough ideas to fill out my coding hobby. If the scope is small or it is directly related to one of my existing features, then go ahead a open a Github ticket.

Q: I cannot find my question in the FAQ, what now? \
A: Ask me about it :smile:
